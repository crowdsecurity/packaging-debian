# Packaging crowdsec for Debian

The goal is to centralize information and possibly tools regarding the
[crowdsec](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/crowdsec) packaging effort
led by [DEBAMAX](https://debamax.com/) in coordination with crowdsec
upstream.

Main resources for now:
 - [progress tracking](doc/progress): a number of packages have to be
   introduced into Debian, and some existing ones need an update.
 - [schroot setup](doc/schroot-setup): a
   [schroot](https://manpages.debian.org/buster/schroot/schroot) crash
   course for developers.
